# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
** Meal simulation model of the glucose-insulin system. **   
Dalla Man C, Rizza RA, Cobelli C._IEEE Trans Biomed Eng._2007

**Abstract:**   
A simulation model of the glucose-insulin system in the postprandial state can
be useful in several circumstances, including testing of glucose sensors,
insulin infusion algorithms and decision support systems for diabetes. Here,
we present a new simulation model in normal humans that describes the
physiological events that occur after a meal, by employing the quantitative
knowledge that has become available in recent years. Model parameters were set
to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a
triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model-independent estimates
of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous
glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing
the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each
subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in
describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
in normal. The same strategy is also applied on a smaller database for
extending the model to type 2 diabetes
